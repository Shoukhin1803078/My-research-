# Text Summarization with LLAMA2 and News Category Dataset

Here is the code link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xGH2t4m2kTPkCTEnZZDVYaXawMGSPvp-#scrollTo=w_tXfklT3g8D

This project explores the use of LLAMA2, an advanced language model, for the task of text summarization. We focus on the News Category Dataset to create a model capable of generating concise and meaningful summaries of news articles.

## 1. Dataset Selection 

### Option: Text Summarization

#### Dataset: News Category Dataset

For this task, I selected the "News Category Dataset" from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles categorized into different topics such as politics, entertainment, sports, etc. I choose this dataset because:

- **Data Size**: The dataset is sufficiently large specially it a broad range of news articles (200000 news articales), which is ideal for building and training models or fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively.
- **Relevance to Real-World Applications**: Summarizing news efficiently is crucial for content aggregation platforms, enabling readers to quickly access and understand key information. News articles reflect real-world events and topics, making the dataset relevant to natural language processing tasks.
- **Potential for Creative Exploration**: The diverse range of news categories allows for creative exploration using prompt engineering techniques.


## 2. Kaggle Model Identification

###  Model: LLAMA2


## Relevant Kaggle Model
After selecting the dataset, I searched for existing models on Kaggle that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs)  for text analysis tasks. I identified the "LLAMA2" model as a relevant option. This model is a pre-trained LLM that can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks. Here I explain some reasons for choosing the LLAMA2 model from my evaluation (My evaluation Code is avaiable in this link: )

- **Capability for Text Analysis Tasks**: The Gemma model has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and question answering, aligning with the objectives of the "News Category Dataset".
- **Availability and Accessibility**: The Gemma model is available on Kaggle and can be easily accessed for experimentation and fine-tuning.

#### Rationale:
- **Relevance**: LLAMA2 is specifically engineered for advanced language understanding and generation, making it highly suitable for producing accurate and contextual summaries.
- **Adaptability**: Given its robust NLP capabilities, LLAMA2 can be fine-tuned to grasp the specific nuances and styles required for effective news summarization.

## 3. Model Capability Evaluation

### LLAMA2

#### Performance Metrics: 
- Utilize metrics like BLEU and ROUGE to measure the quality and accuracy of the generated summaries compared to human-written references.

#### Architecture:
- A comprehensive understanding of LLAMA2â€™s architecture is critical for optimizing its summarization performance.

#### Training/Fine-tuning Potential:
- Evaluate the feasibility of further training LLAMA2 on the news dataset, taking into account factors like computational resources and the volume of data required for effective learning.
