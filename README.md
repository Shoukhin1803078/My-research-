# Take-Home Test: Machine Learning Researcher at BDMLI

Here is the link how I use BERT: https://www.kaggle.com/code/foolofatook/news-classification-using-bert

## Task Overview
This take-home test aims to assess my ability to identify and select relevant datasets and models for specific tasks, understand and explain the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrate technical skills and knowledge in Python and machine learning concepts, and effectively communicate findings and reasoning through clear and concise explanations.

## Dataset Selection
For this task, I selected the "News Category Dataset" from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles categorized into different topics such as politics, entertainment, sports, etc. I chose this dataset because:

- **Data Size**: The dataset is sufficiently large to train or fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively.
- **Relevance to Real-World Applications**: News articles reflect real-world events and topics, making the dataset relevant to natural language processing tasks.
- **Potential for Creative Exploration**: The diverse range of news categories allows for creative exploration using prompt engineering techniques.

## Relevant Kaggle Model
After selecting the dataset, I searched for existing models on Kaggle that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) or similar techniques for text analysis tasks. I identified the "Google Gemma" model as a relevant option. The Gemma model is a pre-trained LLM that can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks. Reasons for choosing the Gemma model include:

- **Capability for Text Analysis Tasks**: The Gemma model has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and question answering, aligning with the objectives of the "News Category Dataset".
- **Availability and Accessibility**: The Gemma model is available on Kaggle and can be easily accessed for experimentation and fine-tuning.

## Evaluation of Model's Capabilities
The Gemma model offers impressive capabilities for natural language understanding and generation tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as text generation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, the model's limitations include computational resource requirements for training and fine-tuning, as well as potential biases present in the pre-trained weights.

# Text Summarization with LLAMA2 and News Category Dataset

Here is the code link:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xGH2t4m2kTPkCTEnZZDVYaXawMGSPvp-#scrollTo=w_tXfklT3g8D

This project explores the use of LLAMA2, an advanced language model, for the task of text summarization. We focus on the News Category Dataset to create a model capable of generating concise and meaningful summaries of news articles.

## 1. Dataset Selection and Rationale

### Option: Text Summarization

#### Dataset: News Category Dataset

#### Rationale:
- **Size and Diversity**: The dataset offers a broad range of news articles, which is ideal for building models that can handle diverse summarization tasks.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Summarizing news efficiently is crucial for content aggregation platforms, enabling readers to quickly access and understand key information.
- **Creative Exploration**: This project provides an opportunity to experiment with different summarization styles and lengths, catering to various reader preferences.

## 2. Kaggle Model Identification

### For Text Summarization

#### Model: LLAMA2

#### Rationale:
- **Relevance**: LLAMA2 is specifically engineered for advanced language understanding and generation, making it highly suitable for producing accurate and contextual summaries.
- **Adaptability**: Given its robust NLP capabilities, LLAMA2 can be fine-tuned to grasp the specific nuances and styles required for effective news summarization.

## 3. Model Capability Evaluation

### LLAMA2

#### Performance Metrics: 
- Utilize metrics like BLEU and ROUGE to measure the quality and accuracy of the generated summaries compared to human-written references.

#### Architecture:
- A comprehensive understanding of LLAMA2â€™s architecture is critical for optimizing its summarization performance.

#### Training/Fine-tuning Potential:
- Evaluate the feasibility of further training LLAMA2 on the news dataset, taking into account factors like computational resources and the volume of data required for effective learning.
