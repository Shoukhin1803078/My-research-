Can you generate a paragraph that consist of  completely different word but the gist is same as this paragraph:

araphrase this paragraph . You should give me completely different paragraph but the content meaning should be same as this paragraph:



Problem description:
Detective Chokro is on the hunt for a murderer who fled the crime scene using the village backroads to avoid
capture. Chokro only has a map showing the main roads, not the hidden backroads. Imagine the city as a
maze. Each intersection is a point labeled from 1 to N, and the main roads connecting them are the visible
paths. The missing connections between these points represent the hidden backroads the murderer might
have taken.

Chokro stands at a specific point S on the map. He needs to find the quickest route through these hidden
backroads to reach any other point in the city. Quickest, in this case, means traveling through the fewest
number of backroads. In other words, Chokro needs to calculate the shortest distance (number of backroads)
between his starting point S and every other point in the city, considering only the hidden backroads
(connections not shown on the map) for travel.

Input Format:

The first line contains T, denoting the number of test cases.

First line of each test case has two integers N, denoting the number of points in the map and M, denoting
the number of roads in the map.

The next M lines each consist of two space-separated integers u and v denoting a main visible road between
point uw and point v.

The last line has an integer S, denoting the current position of Chokro.



Note:

1.There will not be more than one road between any pair of points

2.No points will have a road to itself

3.There will always be a path between any pair of points using the village backroads




Constraints:

a) 1<=T<=10
b) 2<=N<=2*10^5
c) 1<= M <= 120000
d) 1<= u,v,S<= N

Output Format:
For each of T test cases, print a single line consisting of N — 1 space separated integers, denoting the
shortest distances of the remaining N — 1 places from Chokro's position (that is all distances, except the
source node to itself) using the village backroads in ascending order based on intersection number.
